How is the staging area different
from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as a temporary platform to ensure
a more precise commit.  If I have a repository that
contains multiple files, but I've only made edits to one,
I can commit only the files which I've edited by moving them
to the staging area.  Then double-checking the status of my
staging area to ensure I don't commit files which should
be left unchanged.  I think of it as allowing for more
precise documentation when working on a project.
