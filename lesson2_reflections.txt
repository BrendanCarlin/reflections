How is the staging area different
from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as a temporary platform to ensure
a more precise commit.  If I have a repository that
contains multiple files, but I've only made edits to one,
I can commit only the files which I've edited by moving them
to the staging area.  Then double-checking the status of my
staging area to ensure I don't commit files which should
be left unchanged.  I think of it as allowing for more
precise documentation when working on a project.

How can you use the staging area to make sure
you have one commit per logical change?

I can use git commands like git diff and
git diff --staged to compare the difference between
files prior to initializing a git commit.

What are some situations when branches
would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful keeping my
history organized when I want to
experiment with new features on an
existing project, or when I want to build
new versions of the same project to try
a new structure.  Branches allow me
to create different versions of a project,
then editing the files within that project
without overwriting the mastercopy.  Instead,
I have as many versions of a file as I do 
branches until I merge them back to master.
